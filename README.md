# My Personal Website

My personal website is a creative presentation of my portfolio with interactive links as well as work with **React.js**.

## Tech

- React.js
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- HTML5 & CSS

## Development

The **master** branch is the development branch.

### To run locally:

~~~
npm run start
~~~

This will run the site on a localhost:8000

### To deploy on a different branch:

~~~
npm run deploy
~~~

This will create a build for deployment then commit and push the changes the deployment branch.
